All NLP tasks are converted to a text-to-text problem. Tasks such as translation, classification, summarization and question answering, all of them are treated as a text-to-text conversion problem, rather than seen as separate unique problem statements.\n  #####  Unified approach for NLP Deep Learning - Since the task is reflected purely in the text input and output, you can use the same model, objective, training procedure, and decoding process to ANY task. Above framework can be used for any task - show Q&A, summarization, etc.\n  #####  We will be taking inputs from the T5 paper to prepare our dataset prior to fine tuning and training.
